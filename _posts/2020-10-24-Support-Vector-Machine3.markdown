## Introduction

From [post SVM1](https://jennycs005.github.io/2020/10/10/Support-Vector-Machine1/) and [post SVM2](https://jennycs005.github.io/2020/10/24/Support-Vector-Machine2/), we know how to separate training data in linear and non-linear separable cases. But there's no outliers in both cases, which is most happened in real world. In this post, we will see how to deal with those outliers.
